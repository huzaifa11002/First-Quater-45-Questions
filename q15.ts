// Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, 
// so you need to send out a new set of invitations.
// You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

//• Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.

// console.log("One person can't make dinner so I will add new guest ");
// let guestList = ["Ayyan" , "Hamy" , "Babar"]
// let removeGuest = guestList.splice(1,1)[0]

// console.log(`${removeGuest} can't make dinner`);

//Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.

// console.log("Add new Member");

// guestList.push("Zain")

//Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.

// guestList.forEach(myGuest => {
//     console.log(`Hello! ${myGuest}, Your are invited for a dinner`);
// });
